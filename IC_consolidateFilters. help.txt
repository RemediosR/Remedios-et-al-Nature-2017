Consolidates the IC Filters (from Mosaic) that are in the separate .mat files. It transforms them to the same format as ICfilters (Benni).

To do it, you just need to select the first file in IC-Objects folder that contains the IC information, and it will automatically compile the rest in that folder and put a .mat file in the parent directory that contains a stack of filters like ICfilters.
